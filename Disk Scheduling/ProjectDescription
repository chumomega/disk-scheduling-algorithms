We both worked on the logic as well as the documentation

#HW4
The problem statement was to write a program that serviced a disk with 5,000 cylinders.
We will be testing this by generating a random series of 50 requests and servicing them with each of the 3 algorithms we chose

The program will be passed the initial position of the disk head as a parameter on the 
command line and report the total amount of head movement required for each algorithm.
 
There were no assumptions made for this HW yet
